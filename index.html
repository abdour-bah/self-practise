        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used by beginners and professionals alike. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it great for learning how to program. It's widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Thanks to its large community and extensive libraries, Python continues to grow as one of the most popular programming languages in the world. </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>In Python, a variable is used to store data that can be used later in your program. You create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the = sign, like x = 5. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don’t need to declare the type of the variable — it figures it out for you. Variable names should be descriptive and follow naming rules (like no spaces and not starting with a number). You can store different types of data in variables, such as numbers, text (strings), lists, and more.</p>
        <p>What is a Variable?
            A variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
            
            It acts like a label to store data you want to use or modify later.
            
            </p>
           <b><p>Variables Naming Rules</p></b>
           <ul>
            <li>Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore _</li>
            <li>Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores</li>
            <li>Cannot start with a number (❌ 2name = "Bob")</li>
            <li>Cannot use Python keywords (like class, if, def, etc.)</li>
            <li>Case-sensitive: name and Name are different variables</li>
           </ul>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
        <li>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
        <li>Functions can take parameters (inputs) and can return values using the return keyword. </li>
        <li>You call a function by writing its name followed by parentheses, e.g., greet("Alice")</li>
        <li>Functions help organize code, reduce repetition, and make programs easier to read and maintain.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="loops" class="section">
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.</li>
        <li>Python has two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.</li>
        <li>Loops are powerful for automating repetitive tasks and processing data.</li>
